# RStudio

### Four panes

* Source editor
* Console
* Environment and History
* File, Plots, Help etc.

### Getting started

* Comments begin with #. Everything after a # is ignored
  by R.

* Type commands in the _source_ editor.

* To run a command from the _source_ editor place the
  cursor anywhere on that line and press Control-Enter.

* You can also select multiple lines and then press
  Control-Enter to run all the selected lines.

* Finally, you can use Control-Shift-Enter to source the
  entire script.

* The action happens in the _Console_ pane. i.e. any
  output from R is shown in the console frame. You can
  also type commands directly in the console but this
  is not recommended because changing and re-running
  commands directly in the console is inconvenient.

* R keeps a history of your commands which you can see in
  the history tab of RStudio.

* You can select and run commands from the history tab as
  well. Just press enter on the current line or select some
  lines and press enter.

* However you run a command, it is like typing it into
  the console and pressing Enter.
