<ul>
<li><p>Who are we.</p></li>

<h2 id="how-will-this-course-work">How will this course work?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I will introduce methods by talking about them.</p></li>

<li><p>You will have to think how to achieve them in R using as many steps and variables as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I will show you how I would have done the tasks. There are (almost always) more than one way to do it. Your way of doing things might be different from mine but correct nevertheless.</p></li>

## Things mentioned below will be done during the course
### Please don't do them before hand. 

#### Getting the scripts and data we will be using during the course

In Rstudio, use the drop down menu to do

    File -> New File -> R Script

In the blank R script we will write and run
the indented lines shown below. Please do this
with me. Resist the temptation to charge ahead.

~~~ {.r}
    setwd("u:/")
    unlink("Rtrain", recursive = TRUE)
    dir.create("Rtrain")

    setwd("Rtrain")

    getwd()

    unlink("*")

    list.files()
    
    download.file("https://github.com/streptomyces/ThereYouR/raw/master/adr.zip", 
    "adr.zip")

    list.files()

    unzip("adr.zip")

    list.files()
